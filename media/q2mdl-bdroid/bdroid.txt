Other info              : There are three inaccuracies: One, the back of the head has only one prong instead of two (I couldn't tell from the image). Two, he has no thumbs (forgot, then decided to keep them off). Three, he has no backpack. :) Nothing really that drastic, he's still VERY recognizable in the game, though he has a pretty high poly count (sheeewhewwww! 1100+!) and more time could have gone into optimizing him. Sorry for that. :p

* How to use this model *

Unzip to your Quake 2 directory with directories recursed. It'll put it in the proper quake2/baseq2/players/bdroid/ directory all by itself unless you decide to do it your own way, which is fine, but why exert yourself?

Don't reproduce the model without permission, don't use it in a TC without permission, and don't use it for anything other than playing Quake 2 and having fun. also, if you use this PPM and you don't advertise how cool it is and who made it every frag you get, we'll send people to your house to kill you and your family and anyone who ever knew you, including your dog, then piss on your grave and sell your personal possessions to the highest bidder.
